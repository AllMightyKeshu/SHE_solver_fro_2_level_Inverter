# Solving Selective Harmonic Elimination (SHE) Equations for 2-Level Inverter
### Mentor: Prof. Dr. Adil Sarwar

- Focused on solving SHE equations using the Newton-Raphson method, coded in Python.
- Utilized Python libraries like Numpy and minimize from Scipy.optimize to analyze convergence and divergence of solutions.
- The project aims to eliminate specific harmonics in the 2-level inverter for optimized performance.
